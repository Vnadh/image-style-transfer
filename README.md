# image-style-transfer

## Overview
This project is a simple Streamlit application that applies neural style transfer to blend two images: a content image and a style image. The application uses TensorFlow Hub's pre-trained model for arbitrary image stylization.

## Features
- Upload a content image and a style image via the web interface.
- Generate a stylized image by blending the content and style.
- Display the original and stylized images in the app.

## Requirements
To run this app, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- Pillow
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/image-style-transfer-app.git
   cd image-style-transfer-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run style_transfer_app.py
```

## File Structure
- `style_transfer_app.py`: The main application script.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies required to run the app.

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser (the Streamlit server address will be displayed after running the script).
2. Upload a content image and a style image using the provided file uploaders.
3. View the resulting stylized image generated by the neural style transfer model.

## Example Output
- **Content Image**: A photograph or any image you want to retain structure from.
- **Style Image**: An artistic image whose style you want to apply.
- **Stylized Image**: The output image, blending the content and style.
